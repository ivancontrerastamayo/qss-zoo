I've yet to find a good collection of Qt QSS (Stylesheets), so I'm starting the qss-zoo to provide a collection of stylesheets for Qt applications.

For a stylesheet / resource bundle to be hosted in the qss-zoo, it or the project it originates from must have a clearly defined license.

All stylesheets will be rigorously researched to ensure that nobody gets sad when their stylesheet is included - authors will be contacted. All that good stuff.
